# ðŸ“ŒQuick Start

After installing liveMock, you will be able to access the welcome page (a page to create a project). Simply input the project name and submit the form, and you will be redirected to the dashboard page.

### Creating an Expectation

An expectation consists of several matchers and an action. When a request matches all its matchers, the defined action will be taken, such as responding with a JSON.

To create an expectation, click the "Add Expectation" button. After that, you will see the newly created expectation in the list.

### Creating a Matcher

To create a matcher, click the "Add Matcher" button. Change the matcher to "path start_with /" to match all requests.

### Creating an Action

An action defines what the expectation will do. Currently, two actions are supported: custom response and proxy.

To create an action, click the "Create Action" button. By default, the action type is set to custom response, but you can change it to proxy. Once the action is created, click on it and input the desired JSON string in the content field. It will be automatically saved.

### Starting the Project

On the top, you will find a green start button. Clicking it will start the project. Furthermore, ensure that your expectation is activated. You can then visit http://localhost:8088 to see the JSON response.
